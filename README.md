## Binaries
There are currently no binaries available, but when complete, builds will be found at https://v0lttech.com/healthbox.php

## Developer instructions
Are you looking to write an application that uses the HealthBox API? Detailed documentation on how the API works is available in [api.md](/blob/master/api.md).

## Features
### Modular Design
HealthBox is very open and modular, which encourages developers to build software for it that fits their needs. You aren't forced to take any specific approach to managing your health information. If you don't like any of the existing methods, you can even create one completely from scratch yourself!

### Privacy Respecting
With HealthBox, you don't have to worry about your information being recorded, tracked, and collected. You remain in full control of your health data, and you can fully review the code to ensure nothing questionable is happening behind the scenes.

### Easy
The programming interface to interact with HealthBox is very simple and straight forward, allowing even inexperienced programmers to develop for the platform.

### Centralization
Instead of having to use several, or even dozens of external programs, HealthBox gives the potential for developers to store health information in one central place. This improves convenience for both users and developers.

### Secure
HealthBox uses encryption to make sure badly behaving programs can't access your health information without asking for permission.
